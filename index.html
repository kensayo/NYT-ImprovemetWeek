                <p class="paragraph1">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan
                    Guth,
                    with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                    venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
                    should
                    have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
                    begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special
                    energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
                    for a
                    prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
                    uniform
                    from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                    wrinkles
                    and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
                    spit in the
                    ocean.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
                    double box
                    around it.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had
                    seen the
                    beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                <p class="paragraph1">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including
                    Dr.
                    Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
                    to the
                    recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                    vast
                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
                    light-years
                    in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
                    cosmos whose
                    extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
                    endless
                    number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                <p class="paragraph1">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at
                    energies
                    forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
                    itself. Dr.
                    Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                    Einstein’s
                    theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was
                    not part
                    of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
                    telegram
                    encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave
                    radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
                    and as
                    hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for
                    Background
                    Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
                    Center
                    for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

                            something like
                            inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

                <p class="paragraph1">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10
                    million.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected
                    such a
                    definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of
                    observations and
                    analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
                    select
                    few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is
                    his son,
                    Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said
                    Dr.
                    Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular
                    variant
                    of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last
                    week when
                    Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a

                <p class="paragraph1">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but
                    we did
                    not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,”
                    Dr. Linde
                    wrote in an email. </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                    hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said. </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been
                    seen and
                    news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution. </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this
                    stays true,
                    it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a
                    competing
                    project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results
                    are
                    beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits
                    the clash
                    of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate
                    his model,
                    but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                    confirmation,
                    noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                    background by
                    the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its
                    own
                    findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
                    mountaintops
                    and space.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1"><strong class="paragraphtitle">'Spirals in the Sky'</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
                    microwaves,
                    which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
                    won the
                    Nobel Prize.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is
                    one of
                    four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the
                    South
                    Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of
                    the
                    University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
                    Stanford.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,”
                    Dr. Kovac
                    said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
                    said.</p>

                <p class="paragraph1">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was
                    polarized,
                    meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
                    inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by,
                    would
                    twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
                    polarization
                    in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in
                    the
                    temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
                    thermometer.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
                    burning up
                    time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors
                    might beat
                    them to the breakthrough.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1"><strong class="paragraphtitle">'A Special Time'</strong></p>
                <p class="paragraph1">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth,
                    staying up
                    late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of
                    the
                    universe.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                    electromagnetism,
                    and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                    manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph1">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace,
                    like some
                    old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved,
                    with one
                    force after another splitting away.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature
                    falls below
                    32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In
                    that
                    case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
                    antigravity,
                    and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the
                    more space
                    was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
                    trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in
                    less than a
                    cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
                    radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a
                    patch of
                    sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free
                    lunch,”
                    Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s
                    original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled
                    down to a
                    comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other
                    bubbles
                    endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking
                    about
                    going any deeper into the past.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
                    inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial
                    moment are
                    swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
                    astronomer who
                    was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
